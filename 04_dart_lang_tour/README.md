# Important Concepts

## Everything we place in a variable is an object.
  - Every <span style="color:cyan">object</span> is instance of a `class`
  - All <span style="color:cyan">objects</span> inherit from `Object` class.
  - Even  `numbers`, `functions` and `null` are objects.

## Dart is `stongly typed`
  - type annoataion is optional as `dart can infer types` at compile time.
    ```
    var number = 42;
    ```
    In the above code, `number` is inferred to be if type `int`
  - `dyanmic` is used when we want to say that `no type is expected`.
    ```
    var aNumber = 42;

     /**
      * The constructor returns type 'Object' that isn't of expected type 'int' 
      * [strong_mode_invalid_cast_new_expr]. 
      **/ 
    aNumber = new Object(); // compilation error
    ```
    ```
    dynamic var2 = 21;
    /**
     * var2 is dynamic so , can be assigned anything
     */
    var2 = new Object(); // no compilation error
    ```

## Dart supports `generic` types
  - `List<int>` is a list of integers.
  - `List<dynamic>` is a list of objects of any type.

## Types of Functions & Variables
  - top level functions/variables (Eg., `main()` function , variables outside of a class).
    - We can create functions within functions (nested or local functions).
  - functions/variables tied to a class - `static` methods inside a class.
  - functions/variables tied to an object - instance methods inside a class.
    - instance variables are sometimes called `fields` or `properties`.

## Visibility of identifiers
  - Identifiers starting with <span style="color:cyan">`_`</span> are private to it's library.
    - <span style="color:cyan">Libraries not only provide APIs, but are a unit of privacy. </span>
    - <span style="color:cyan">The import and library directives can help you create a modular and shareable code base.</span>

## Dart `Expressions` and `Statements`
  - expressions have run-time values  (Eg., conditional expression `codition? expr1 : expr2`).
  - Statements doesn't have run-time values  (Eg., `if-else` statement).

## Dart Tools - Classification of Problems
  - `warnings` - indications that code might not work, but doesn't prevent from executing.
  - `errors` 
    - `compile-time` - prevent the code from executing at all.
    - `run-time` - result in an <span style="color:cyan">exception</span> being raised while the code executes.

## Dart built-in types
  - numbers
  - strings
  - booleans
  - lists (also known as arrays)
  - maps 
  - runes (for expressing `Unicode characters` in string)
    - are the UTF-32 code points of a string.
    - extends `Iterable<int>`.
    - UTF 32 code point Eg:  ```var clapping = '\u{1f44f}';```
    - Runes Eg: 
      ```
      Runes input = new Runes(
      '\u2665  \u{1f605}  \u{1f60e}  \u{1f47b}  \u{1f596}  \u{1f44d}');
      print(new String.fromCharCodes(input));
      ```
  - symbols 
    - represents an `operator or identifier` declared in a Dart program
    - theyâ€™re <span style=color:red>invaluable for APIs that refer to identifiers by name</span>, because minification changes identifier names but not identifier symbols.
    - To get the symbol for an identifier, `use a symbol literal`, which is just <span style=color:orange># followed by the identifier</span>.
    - symbol literals are `compile-time constants`.

## Parameter types
  - positional parameters
  - named parameters

## Variable Assignment 
 - Const variables must be initialized with a constant value.
